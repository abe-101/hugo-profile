## Options
Having realize the quality of a webcam, we considered our options.
 1. A proper webcam that connects to the computer
 2. A smartphone on a tripod
 3. A proper camera and on a tripod and stream directly to youtube

Ultimetly we went with 3, a proper camera on a tripod, although more expensive we got top qaulity equipment.

## Setup
The setup went like this:

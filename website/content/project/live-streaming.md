Recently at work we transformed our streaming equipment. We went from using a chrome book webcam to top of the line Sony camera.

## Sony ZV-E10 Mirrorless Camera

Perfect for vloggers, the **Sony ZV-E10** pairs a large APS-C sensor and mirrorless versatility with a specialized feature-set built just for content creators. Improving upon the ubiquitous smartphone, the ZV-E10 is an Alpha camera that brings improved image quality, greater choice of lenses, and increased control to up your creativity when shooting.

## Tamron 17-70mm f/2.8 Di III-A VC RXD Lens for Sony E

Spanning a versatile zoom range and characterized by its bright design, the **Tamron 17-70mm f/2.8 Di III-A VC RXD** is a 25.5-105mm-equivalent lens for APS-C-format Sony E-mount mirrorless cameras. The wide to short-tele range is ideal for everyday shooting and the fast f/2.8 constant maximum aperture suits working in difficult lighting conditions and offers improved control over depth of field.

## GEEKOTO AT24EVO Compact Aluminum Tripod

The **AT24EVO Compact Aluminum Tripod** from **GEEGOTO**is a 4-section support system with strong aluminum flip locks that allow you to adjust the tripod’s working height from 23 to 77″. It features a sturdy load capacity of 17.6 lb, and the tripod legs feature independent leg angle locks for shooting on uneven surfaces and inclines. The AT24EVO can be quickly disassembled and transformed into a monopod with a working range of 34.5 to 82″, and you can invert the center column for macro photography. A 360° panoramic ball head lets you make smooth pans and 360° scales enable precise image alignment for landscape shots that require stitching. Folded length is a compact 19″, and a carrying bag is included.

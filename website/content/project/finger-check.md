fingercheck.com is an awesome platform fully customizable great HR platform.

The challenge we faced was unique to our companies schedule. We have the employees check in and out multiple times throughout the day.
Clocking in and out
For months our company was manually going over the records of when employees checked in and out to calculate when they came late warmest day.
When you’re dealing with 20 guys doing this once a month seems possible.
This year we grew to 40 employees
We needed a better solution.

Fingercheck
Challenge #1: The platform is built to support a typical working day with one check in one check out and a break or two. Our schedule on the other hand had employees check in and out three times throughout the day. Finger check wasn’t built to recognize that.
Solution #1: make use of the Break policy.

Challenge #2: The platform is built to allow breaks counted five minutes but we needed a break it has a start and end time

Solution #2: Here comes the rounding Policy. We simply round back the clock out to the time the break begins and allow x amount of minutes for the break.

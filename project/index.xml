After teaching us python, SQL, HTML CSS and JS it had us build a fully functional web app. A paper trading app. Given just a basic flask app structure with login, logout, price lookup, user database and an error page. We had to build the rest. Which included registering, buying and selling stock, quote, history page and a index page. It was necessary to build more tables in the database to keep track of transactions.</description></item></channel></rss>

Tested on Raspberry Pi 3B &amp;amp; 4B with Ubuntu Server 21.04 &amp;amp; Debian 11
Introduction This guide will show you how to encrypt your Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s root partition and set up an initramfs that will prompt for the password, decrypt the partition and gracefully resume boot. You will also learn how to enable SSH during this pre-boot stage, allowing you to unlock the partition remotely.</description></item><item><title>Self Hosted</title><link>https://habet.dev/blog/self-hosted/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 22:41:04 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://habet.dev/blog/self-hosted/</guid><description>This blog is self hosted on a small raspberry pi. Smaller than the size of your hand. I choose this model with a Crucial SSD you can find here. You’ll need a wire like this to connect them.

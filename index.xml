It&amp;rsquo;s now time to start utilizing it. In this guide we will be setting up Nextcloud.
Nextcloud is a free (Open Source) Dropbox-like software. The project is written in PHP and JavaScript. It supports many database systems such as MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database and SQLite.
To allow Synchronization between server, desktop and mobile phone, Nextcloud provides applications for Windows, Linux and Mac desktop.</description></item><item><title>Abe's finance</title><link>https://habet.dev/project/abes-finance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 11:30:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://habet.dev/project/abes-finance/</guid><description>This was CS50 Building this project challenged my skills. After teaching us python, SQL, HTML CSS and JS it had us build a fully functional web app. A paper trading app. Given just a basic flask app structure with login, logout, price lookup, user database and an error page. We had to build the rest. Which included registering, buying and selling stock, quote, history page and a index page. It was necessary to build more tables in the database to keep track of transactions.</description></item><item><title>Bagel Shop App</title><link>https://habet.dev/project/bagel-shop-app/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 11:30:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://habet.dev/project/bagel-shop-app/</guid><description>CS50x Final Project As part of Harvards CS50x course we had to build our own project. I chose to solve a real world problem. We have a local study group that orders breakfast together. The problem is how can each member select what they want? This app attempts to solve it.
Bagel Shop App The app is built using Python and Flask which depends on the Jinja template engine. The idea behind the app is simple, allow members to select breakfast for the week.</description></item><item><title>Self Hosting and Securing Web Services Out of Your Home With Cloudflare Tunnel</title><link>https://habet.dev/blog/self-hosting-and-securing-web-services-out-of-your-home-with-cloudflare-tunnel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 00:49:45 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://habet.dev/blog/self-hosting-and-securing-web-services-out-of-your-home-with-cloudflare-tunnel/</guid><description>Why a tunnel? Opening up a port on a home network isn’t the greatest idea. It is a security risk, a hole waiting for a hacker/bot to sneak in using a known vulnerability. Many ISP‘s and routers prevent you from opening up ports 80 and 443. Another challenge you will face is setting up a dynamic DNS. Finally, when your domain is pointing to your home IP address it is very easy to determine your home location.</description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi Encrypted Boot With Ssh</title><link>https://habet.dev/blog/raspberry-pi-encrypted-boot-with-ssh/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 00:39:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://habet.dev/blog/raspberry-pi-encrypted-boot-with-ssh/</guid><description>Please note this project is a fork from ViRb3, I&amp;rsquo;ve made some minor changes here.
Tested on Raspberry Pi 3B &amp;amp; 4B with Ubuntu Server 21.04 &amp;amp; Debian 11
Introduction This guide will show you how to encrypt your Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s root partition and set up an initramfs that will prompt for the password, decrypt the partition and gracefully resume boot. You will also learn how to enable SSH during this pre-boot stage, allowing you to unlock the partition remotely.</description></item><item><title>Self Hosted</title><link>https://habet.dev/blog/self-hosted/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 22:41:04 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://habet.dev/blog/self-hosted/</guid><description>This blog is self hosted on a small raspberry pi. Smaller than the size of your hand. I choose this model with a Crucial SSD you can find here. You’ll need a wire like this to connect them.

The OS of choice is Debian 11 because of its stability. I always prefer to encrypt my hardware, so I have nothing to worry about if it lands in other hands.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://habet.dev/blog/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 22:01:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://habet.dev/blog/hello-world/</guid><description>Hello World Welcome to habet.dev.

I chose to solve a real world problem. We have a local study group that orders breakfast together. The problem is how can each member select what they want? This app attempts to solve it.
Bagel Shop App The app is built using Python and Flask which depends on the Jinja template engine. The idea behind the app is simple, allow members to select breakfast for the week.</description></item></channel></rss>
